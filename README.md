# Pack the Box.

For anyone who has moved before, there are countless possibilities to pack the shipping container. If all items are the same size and shape, what space efficiency can be achieved by random placement of items inside the container?

* Is efficiency greater or smaller when items are smaller?
* What shapes fare better than others?
* Does the size of the container matter?

Test your hypotheses, and see how efficient your outcomes can be.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

PREREQUISITES

The algorithm is built to run with Python 3. The [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/turtle.html) graphics library executes the drawing functions to visualize the spatial outcome. Turtle uses [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter) for its graphics, so be sure to install a version of Python with Tk support.

## Running your Tests

A few instructions to start testing your hypotheses:

Clone the git repository.

```
https://github.com/tdiede/packthebox.git
```

Run the script.py file and input your initial container dimensions.


```
python script.py
What is the height of your container? default:600 >>>
What is the width of your container? default:500 >>>
```

The shape of the item is randomized between a rectangle or a circle.
Enter your desired dimensions, depending on the shape.

```
What is the desired height/width of your rectangle? default:40,90 >>>
What is the desired radius of your circle? default:40 >>>
```

The script will execute based on these parameters and the random placement of items in the container.
At the end, the spatial efficiency value is returned.
